### Regression of Anxiety on Stress Survey

#| echo: false
# Fit the bivariate regression model
X1 = observDF[['StressSurvey']]
y = observDF['Anxiety']

# Using statsmodels for detailed output
X1_sm = sm.add_constant(X1)

print(f"StressSurvey (β₁): {stress_coef:.4f}")
print(f"\nRegression Equation: Anxiety = {intercept:.4f} + {stress_coef:.4f} × StressSurvey")
```

---

**INTERPRETATION:**

The regression using StressSurvey produces the equation Anxiety = –1.52 + 1.05 × StressSurvey. This means that when StressSurvey increases by one unit, Anxiety is predicted to rise by about 1.05 units. The intercept of –1.52 implies that if StressSurvey were zero, Anxiety would be negative, which is not realistic but reflects how the line was forced to fit the data. Compared to the true relationship, which is Anxiety = Stress + 0.1 × Time, the slope is too high. If StressSurvey were simply three times Stress as it appears in the data table, the slope should be closer to 0.33, not 1.05. The reason for the inflation is that the model leaves out Time, which is correlated with StressSurvey, so the regression mistakenly shifts part of Time’s effect onto StressSurvey. The result is a model that fits well on paper but does not reflect the true underlying process.

**SCATTER PLOT INTERPRETATION:**

The scatter plot shows a strong linear relationship between StressSurvey and Anxiety with a high R^2 value. Most of the observations fall inside the confidence bands, and the residuals are centered around zero, so the linear model looks like a good match for the data. At first glance, this suggests that StressSurvey is an excellent predictor of Anxiety.

However, upon further examination there are some potential issues. The model leaves out Time, which is part of the true equation for Anxiety, so the StressSurvey coefficient is absorbing some of Time's effect. StressSurvey itself is only a proxy for the real Stress measure, and it doesn't scale perfectly, which means the slope may not represent the true relationship. Even though the R² value is very high, that alone doesn't prove the coefficients are correct.

## Question 3: Bivariate Regression of Anxiety on Time

### Regression of Anxiety on Time

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Fit the bivariate regression model: Anxiety ~ Time
X2 = observDF[['Time']]
X2_sm = sm.add_constant(X2)
model2 = sm.OLS(y, X2_sm).fit()

# Display the regression results
print(model2.summary())
```

### Estimated Coefficients for Time Model

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Print the estimated coefficients for the Time model
intercept_time = model2.params['const']
time_coef = model2.params['Time']

print("Estimated Coefficients (Anxiety ~ Time):")
print("======================================")
print(f"Intercept (β₀): {intercept_time:.4f}")
print(f"Time (β₁): {time_coef:.4f}")
print(f"\nRegression Equation: Anxiety = {intercept_time:.4f} + {time_coef:.4f} × Time")
```

---

**INTERPRETATION:**

The regression using Time produces the equation Anxiety = –3.68 + 5.34 × Time. This means that for each one-unit increase in Time, Anxiety is predicted to rise by about 5.34 units. The intercept of –3.68 suggests that if Time were zero, Anxiety would be negative, which isn’t realistic but reflects how the line was adjusted to fit the data. Compared to the true relationship, which is Anxiety = Stress + 0.1 × Time, the slope is far too large. The true effect of Time is only 0.1, but because Stress and Time rise together in this dataset, the regression gives Time credit for Stress’s much stronger effect. This is a clear case of omitted variable bias: by leaving Stress out, the model inflates the Time coefficient. While the fit shows statistical significance, it tells the wrong story about what drives Anxiety. In practice, the model looks convincing but is misleading because it exaggerates Time’s role and ignores the real driver.

### Interpretation: Comparison to True Relationship

---

**INTERPRETATION:**

The multiple regression gives the equation Anxiety = 0.589 + 1.427 × StressSurvey − 2.780 × Time, with R² = 0.935. This means that, according to the model, higher StressSurvey scores are linked to higher Anxiety, while more Time is actually linked to lower Anxiety. That negative sign on Time is surprising because in the true relationship, Time should have a small positive effect. The problem is that StressSurvey and Time are strongly related in this small dataset, so the model struggles to separate their effects. This "multicollinearity" makes the coefficients unstable—StressSurvey's effect looks too large, and Time's effect even flips direction. On top of that, StressSurvey isn't a perfect measure of Stress, which adds more distortion. The high R² shows the line fits the data well, but the coefficients don't give a trustworthy picture of the true process. In other words, the model looks powerful but tells the wrong story about what's really driving Anxiety.

## Multiple Regression of Anxiety on Stress and Time


### Multiple Regression Model (Using Actual Stress)

```{python}
#| echo: false

print(f"\nRegression Equation: Anxiety = {intercept_stress:.4f} + {stress_coef_true:.4f} × Stress + {time_coef_stress:.4f} × Time")
```

### Comparison with True Relationship (Perfect Match Expected!)

---

**INTERPRETATION:**

The multiple regression of Anxiety on both Stress and Time gives us Anxiety = 0.000 + 1.000 × Stress + 0.100 × Time, with R² = 0.935. This happens to be the True coefficients given to us in the problem.

**📝 FINAL INTERPRETATION - Model Comparison:**

*Based on all four regression models, write your final interpretation:*
- *Which model performed best and why?*
- *How did Model 4 (Stress + Time) compare to Model 3 (StressSurvey + Time)?*
- *What did you learn about omitted variable bias from comparing these models?*
- *What did you learn about using proxy variables (StressSurvey vs Stress)?*
- *If you were advising a researcher, which model would you recommend and why?*
